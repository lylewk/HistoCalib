\title{Write "x.new" from input OPD and osteon diameter}
\usage{
convert()
}
\value{
returns a vector "x.new".  This will display on the screen but,
more importantly, will also write to your workspace as input for all further
scripts.  The vector has 1.0 as its first element (for the intercept in
multiple regression).
}
\description{
This is an interactive script that will have you enter
the OPD and average complete secondary osteon diameter in mm.
}
\details{
After entering your values for these two variables, the script
will apply the "gpower" transformation (Kelansky et al. 2013: eqn. 5) to
OPD and leave the diameter variable unchanged. NOTE: This script must be run
before any of the other scripts in this package.
